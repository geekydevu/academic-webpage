## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/dp1.jpg" >}}

I am a Masters research student at the [MILA Lab](https://mila.quebec/en/) and McGill University with [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/), and a research intern at Korbit.AI.

## Research Interest

My ongoing research focuses on neural question generation from open educational resources (e.g. Wikipedia) for statistics and Machine Learning domain.

Apart from research, I also like learning vocal Indian classical music and meditation.
